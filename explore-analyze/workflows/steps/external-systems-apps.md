# External systems and apps steps

External systems actions allow your workflows to communicate with third-party services and custom endpoints. You can interact with external systems in the following ways:

* [Connector-based actions](#connector-based-actions): Use pre-configured connectors to integrate with services such as Slack and {{jira}}
* [HTTP actions](#http-actions): Make HTTP requests to APIs directly or through a configured HTTP connector

## Connector-based actions

Connector-based actions use {{kib}}'s centralized {{connectors-ui}} framework. Before using them, you must first [configure a connector](/deploy-manage/manage-connectors.md).

The step `type` is a keyword for the service (for example, `slack` or `jira`). You must also provide a `connector-id` at the same level as `type`.

To view the available connectors, click **Actions menu** and select **External Systems & Apps**. 

### Identify a connector

The `connector-id` field accepts one of the following:

* The unique name you gave the connector (for example, `"my-slack-connector"`). This is the recommended method for readability.
* The connector's raw ID (for example, `"d6b62e80-ff9b-11ee-8678-0f2b2c0c3c68"`).

### Example: Send a Slack notification

This example uses a pre-configured Slack connector named `"security-alerts-channel"`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: notify_security_channel
    type: slack
    connector-id: "security-alerts-channel"
    with:
      message: "High-priority alert: {{ event.name }}. Please investigate immediately."
```

### Example: Create a {{jira}} issue

This example uses a {{jira}} connector named `"engineering-project"`.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: create_jira_ticket
    type: jira
    connector-id: "engineering-project"
    with:
      projectKey: "ENG"
      issueType: "Task"
      summary: "Automated Task: Review '{{ event.name }}'"
      description: "Workflow '{{ workflow.name }}' requires manual review for a potential issue."
```

## HTTP actions

The native `http` action is a built-in HTTP client for calling external APIs. It supports two modes:

* **Configured HTTP connector**: For authenticated requests, first [configure an HTTP connector](/deploy-manage/manage-connectors.md). Then reference it from the workflow step with `connector-id`. The connector stores the base URL, authentication settings, and secrets using {{kib}}'s centralized {{connectors-ui}} framework.
* **Direct URL**: For simple requests that don't require connector-managed secrets, omit `connector-id` and provide the full `url` directly in the step. Avoid placing secrets directly in workflow YAML.

### Create an HTTP connector

You can create an HTTP connector from **Stack Management > Connectors** by selecting the **HTTP** connector type.

![Select the HTTP connector type from Stack Management](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-http-connector-stack-management.png "")

In the connector flyout, set the connector ID, base URL, authentication, and any encrypted headers that should be stored with the connector.

![Configure an HTTP connector with authentication and encrypted headers](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-http-connector-flyout.png "")

You can also create or select a connector without leaving the workflow editor. Type `connector-id:` in an HTTP step and select **Create a new connector**. After you save the connector in the flyout, its connector ID is added to the workflow YAML.

![Create or select an HTTP connector from connector-id autocomplete](/explore-analyze/images/workflows-http-connector-autocomplete.png "")

Use the following parameters in the `with` block to configure the request:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `url` | Yes, when `connector-id` is not provided | The full URL of the endpoint to call. |
| `path` | No | The path appended to the configured connector's base URL. Use this with `connector-id`. |
| `method` | No (defaults to `GET`) | The HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE`). |
| `headers` | No | An object with key-value pairs for additional HTTP headers. Request headers take precedence over connector headers. |
| `query` | No | An object with key-value pairs for query string parameters. |
| `body` | No | The request body (typically a JSON object). |

Use a configured HTTP connector:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: trigger_response_action
    type: http
    connector-id: "security-response-api"
    with:
      path: "/v1/response-actions/isolate"
      method: "POST"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
      body:
        endpoint_id: "{{ event.agent.id }}"
        reason: "Triggered by workflow '{{ workflow.name }}'"
```

Call a URL directly without a connector:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: trigger_custom_automation
    type: http
    with:
      url: "https://hooks.example.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
      method: "POST"
      headers:
        Content-Type: "application/json"
      body:
        event_id: "{{ event.id }}"
        message: "Workflow action triggered by '{{ workflow.name }}'"
```
